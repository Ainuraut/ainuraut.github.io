<h1>The history of Astana</h1>
<!--<p>Astana is a city of businessmen</p>-->
<p>Astana was proclaimed the capital of Kazakhstan on 10th December 1997 by the President of Kazakhstan and the Parliament. The international presentation of Astana, as the new capital of Kazakhstan, was held on 10th June 1998. Today the city's territory is over 200 sq. km.
</p>

<p>In 1999 Astana was awarded with the medal and title of <b>City of Peace by UNESCO</b>. The first capital of Kazakhstan was Orenburg (now in the Russian Federation) in 1920 then it was moved to Kyzylorda in 1925. The construction of the Turkish railway was the main reason for transferring the capital to Alma-Ata in 1929.
</p>			

<p>The capital was moved from Almaty to Astana for economic, ecological and geographical reasons. Almaty is too far from the actual geographic center of the country. The population in Almaty is close to 1.5 million with no further prospects for accommodation. In fact the city is fairly overbuilt, densely populated and has no spare areas for development. Transport is also a problem. Year in year out the ecological condition of the 'southern capital' deteriorates dramatically. It is one of the most polluted cities in Kazakhstan. Astana was chosen as the best alternative, based on a nation-wide study taking into account 32 parameters including socioeconomic indices, climate, landscape, seismic condition, natural environment, engineering and transport infrastructure, construction facilities and work force.</p>
